# Online_PDF_Security

1. This project is developed using blockchain's inherent features, including decentralization, immutability, and encryption, to fortify PDF document security. Through this solution, users can secure their PDF files, ensuring their integrity and authenticity while preventing unauthorized access and tampering.
2. The main aim of this project is to create a platform for Authors to sell their Books/PDF online. Today's solution have the drawbacks like if one users purchases the book/pdf online he can then send it to anyone absolutely free.
3. To avoid this problem we have created a Blockchain platform where only authenticated users can only view the Book/PDF online, without the access to download or share it to other people.
4. This helps the Authors to get paid for each and every user viewing their Book/PDF.
